This is why solutions have to be decentralized and transparent. At the moment all \"verification\" solutions provided by the various advertising technology and anti ad fraud companies are based on propriety technology, and are centralized and opaque.\r\n\r\nM5K is an open challenge to address this problem.\r\n\r\n#### more information on the MEDIA5K Challenge here: http://botlab.io/media5k\r\n\r\nThis is part of the starter kit for MEDIA5K challenge where the goal is to accurately identify spam sites. The remaining part can be found on the link provided above.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, the script provided here is intented for research use only and for anything else than limited number of sites for early research purpose, please consider using the respective API.\r\n\r\nThere are two \"versions\":\r\n\r\n1) m5k.sh is the script that are used for generating the media5000 index\r\n2) signals.sh is the script that can be used for generating 39 different meta-data points about the site\r\n\r\n\r\n## system requirements\r\n\r\nBefore you can run the scripts, you need to have these installed in the system you are going to run the scripts from\r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install numsum\r\n    sudo cpan install HTML::Strip\r\n    sudo apt-get install R\r\n    sudo apt-get upgrade \r\n    \r\nTo run the m5k.sh script with compound scores calculated, you will also need to have access to Twitter API.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sferik/t -> when you do so, it's probably better to do: \r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install build-essential\r\n\r\nIn addition I've found that sometimes you have to do:\r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get update --fix-missing\r\n\r\n## additional requirements\r\n\r\nFor running either of these scripts, you should have: \r\n\r\n - list of common user-agents that go to m5k.ua file\r\n - list of few IP from a common VPN solution you have access to \r\n - a sell-side event log that becomes the sample file\r\n\r\n\r\n## combound scores (m5k.sh)\r\n###### this is the version that is used for calculating the latest scores in http://botlab.io/media5k\r\n\r\nWhile the signals.sh version (below) does not expect you to have a large ad event log, m5k.sh does. So if you don't have such a file, move below to the other version. Or alternatively you could remove the traffic based scores from the script. \r\n\r\nBecause the intended use is for large files, this script assumes that you've first run indexer.sh to build an index of your event (log) file/s. \r\n\r\n\r\n## metrics (signals.sh)\r\n###### in addition to the version we've used for calculation the scores on the index, we're also making available a set of direct signals from Alexa.com, WOT, Similar Web and WHOIS.
