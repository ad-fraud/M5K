# M5K
starter kit for MEDIA5K challenge where the goal is to accurately identify spam sites 

First and foremost, the script provided here is intented for research use only and for anything larger than a few thousand sites, you should use Alexa and WOT API access instead.

- list of common user-agents that go to m5k.ua file
- list of few IP from a common VPN solution you have access to 
- a sell-side event log that becomes the sample file

Because the intended use is for large files, this script assumes that you've first run indexer.sh to build an index of your event file/s.
