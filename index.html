<p>This is part of the starter kit for MEDIA5K challenge where the goal is to accurately identify spam sites. The remaining part can be found on the link provided above.</p>

<p>First and foremost, the script provided here is intented for research use only and for anything else than limited number of sites for early research purpose, please consider using the respective API.</p>

<p>There are two "versions":</p>

<p>1) m5k.sh is the script that are used for generating the media5000 index
2) signals.sh is the script that can be used for generating 39 different meta-data points about the site</p>

<h2>
<a id="system-requirements" class="anchor" href="#system-requirements" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>system requirements</h2>

<p>Before you can run the scripts, you need to have these installed in the system you are going to run the scripts from</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install numsum
sudo cpan install HTML::Strip
sudo apt-get install R
sudo apt-get upgrade 
</code></pre>

<p>To run the m5k.sh script with compound scores calculated, you will also need to have access to Twitter API.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/sferik/t">https://github.com/sferik/t</a> -&gt; when you do so, it's probably better to do: </p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install build-essential
</code></pre>

<p>In addition I've found that sometimes you have to do:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update --fix-missing
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a id="additional-requirements" class="anchor" href="#additional-requirements" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>additional requirements</h2>

<p>For running either of these scripts, you should have: </p>

<ul>
<li>list of common user-agents that go to m5k.ua file</li>
<li>list of few IP from a common VPN solution you have access to </li>
<li>a sell-side event log that becomes the sample file</li>
</ul>

<a id="combound-scores-m5ksh" class="anchor" href="#combound-scores-m5ksh" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>combound scores (m5k.sh)</h2>

<a id="this-is-the-version-that-is-used-for-calculating-the-latest-scores-in-httpbotlabiomedia5k" class="anchor" href="#this-is-the-version-that-is-used-for-calculating-the-latest-scores-in-httpbotlabiomedia5k" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>this is the version that is used for calculating the latest scores in <a href="http://botlab.io/media5k">http://botlab.io/media5k</a>
</h6>

<p>While the signals.sh version (below) does not expect you to have a large ad event log, m5k.sh does. So if you don't have such a file, move below to the other version. Or alternatively you could remove the traffic based scores from the script. </p>

<p>Because the intended use is for large files, this script assumes that you've first run indexer.sh to build an index of your event (log) file/s. </p>
